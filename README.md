      <h2> About us </h2> 
      <p> WSW was founded after our CEO, William, saw a watch that his friend had pulled apart, the watch had it dial pulled off and William fell in love with the design. <br>
      <br> Using this 'no-dial' design William designed the company's first watch: the <b> William Severin One </b>. The <b> William Severin One </b> sported blue hands and a blue and white striped nato strap. <br>
      <br> Later that year WSW released the <b> William Severin Two </b>, the <b> William Severin Two </b> features red hands and a Khaki strap while keeping the theme of not having a dial similar to the <b> William Severin One </b> <br> 
      <br> Now the company makes all sorts of watches tailored to the customers taste and is currently working on a sporty chronograph  </p>
